# Uncommon HTML Bug: Nesting Paragraph Tags with innerHTML This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using innerHTML to inject HTML content containing nested paragraph tags.  The issue arises from how browsers interpret and render such nested structures, particularly when the outer container is dynamically created.  The `bug.html` file showcases the problem, while `solution.html` provides a corrected approach using safer DOM manipulation techniques.  This bug highlights the importance of secure and well-structured HTML practices, particularly when using dynamic content insertion.
